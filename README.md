# sorting-algorithms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## over view
this project is intended to visualize sorting algorithms. /n
the algorithms that are shown are : bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and cocktail sort. /n
programming language used to program this simulation : c++. /n
library to interact and create graphics : raylib. /n

## how to use
to choose the algorithm you want to visualize you just simply need to click the button.
if you wish to increase fps or decrease just use the left and right arrows on keyboard.
if you want to pause the algorithm just press the pause button than again to resume.
and lastly to suffle the list just click the shuffle button.

## uses
the project is intended first for fun!.
secondly if you want to learn sorting algorithms this is very recomended way because it is 
easier to understand the algorithm by looking at visualazation rather than just watching or
reading a tutorial.
