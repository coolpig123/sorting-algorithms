# sorting-algorithms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## overview
this project is intended to visualize sorting algorithms. </br>
the algorithms that are shown are : bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and cocktail sort. </br>
programming language used to program this simulation : c++. </br>
library to interact and create graphics : raylib. </br>

## how to use
to choose the algorithm you want to visualize you just simply need to click the button. </br>
if you wish to increase fps or decrease just use the left and right arrows on keyboard. </br>
if you want to pause the algorithm just press the pause button than again to resume. </br>
and lastly to suffle the list just click the shuffle button. </br>

## uses
the project is intended first for fun!. </br>
secondly if you want to learn sorting algorithms this is very recomended way because it is  </br>
easier to understand the algorithm by looking at visualazation rather than just watching or </br>
reading a tutorial. </br>
